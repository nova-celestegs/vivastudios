    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 27, 2026</p>

    <p><strong>Endless Runner 2D</strong> ("the App") is developed by GameStudio. This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use the App.</p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>The App does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or transmit any personal information. All game data (high scores, settings, unlocked items) is stored locally on your device using standard device storage and is never sent to any server.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The current version of the App does not use any third-party services that collect information. If future versions integrate advertising or analytics services, this policy will be updated accordingly.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App does not knowingly collect personal information from children. Since the App does not collect any data, it is safe for users of all ages.</p>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>The App may request the following device permissions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Vibration</strong> - Used solely for haptic feedback during gameplay (e.g., power-up effects). No data is collected through this feature.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>Since no personal data is collected or transmitted, there is no risk of data breach from our App. Game progress is stored locally on your device.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the new policy.</p>
